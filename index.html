                                                </a>

                                                One of the major quests of modern extragalactic astronomy is to pinpoint the birth of the first stars and galaxies and constrain their assembly histories over the first Gyr of the Universe. To this end, NIR surveys with HST and ground-based telescopes do not probe far enough into the NIR to directly detect the very first objects - such a feat will have to await the NIR capabilities of JWST. However, recent results using the Spitzer Space Telescope have revealed a promising alternative: at z>7 the Spitzer/IRAC bands probe the rest-frame optical of Reionization-era galaxies and thus can yield valuable constraints on their SFRs, stellar masses and stellar ages. More specifically, observations of bright, z>9 galaxies have revealed several sources for which especially red Spitzer/IRAC colours unambiguously reveal the presence of a significant rest-frame 4000 A Balmer break - indicative of mature (>100 Myrs) stellar populations - which can greatly aid in age-dating the stellar populations of the earliest galaxies and indirectly constrain the timing of Cosmic Dawn. At lower redshifts (z~7-9), however, the cause of such red Spitzer/IRAC colours is not so clear cut: large degeneracies arise due to the contamination of the filters by strong (EW>1000 A) [OIII]5007 A + Hbeta nebular emission lines indicative of gas excited by young stellar populations. Thus, distinguishing between the two scenarios is a prerequisite towards determining the prevalence of Balmer break objects at 7&lt;z&lt;9 and, for the brightest sources, placing tighter constraints on a potential steepening of the cosmic SFR density at z>8, indicative of younger (&lt;100 Myrs) galaxy ages. In this talk I will detail our recent efforts to break this degeneracy at z&lt;9 with ALMA spectroscopy of confirmed sources and our ground-based spectroscopic campaign to confirm and characterise z&gt;9 objects, all with suspected Balmer breaks. Together with detailed SED-modelling, we aim to determine the prevalence of so-called Balmer break galaxies at 7&lt;z&lt;10 and place tighter constraints on the ages of the underlying stellar populations for the brightest (H~&lt;26 AB) such galaxies. Our spectroscopic and modelling results suggest the photometry of 7/10 of our selected 7&lt;z&lt;10 galaxies are dominated by Balmer break contributions and stellar ages >100 Myrs, while the rest can be explained with strong nebular emission lines and stellar ages &lt;10 Myr. We discuss the implications of our results on the cosmic accretion rate of the brightest galaxies and further demonstrate how the arrival of new facilities such as JWST will settle the debate with only a few hours of observations with e.g., NIRCam and/or NIRSpec.

                                                In the recent years HST observations of blank fields enabled us to detect galaxies as far as z~11. However, very little is known about those galaxies, and they are mostly the most luminous representatives.  Clusters of galaxies, when used as cosmic telescopes, can greatly simplify the task of studying and finding normal galaxies at high redshifts. Several large surveys have recently been executed (CLASH, HFF, Relics) and several are planned with JWST  with the main goal of identifying and studying star formation of galaxies at z > 7. I will present results from Spitzer and Keck showing successful measurements of the properties of stellar populations. I will also present the latest measurements of the neutral fraction of hydrogen, signifying the end of epoch of reionization. I will conclude by identifying new puzzles facing future surveys at z~7 and beyond.

                                                The cosmic star formation history describes when galaxies formed their stars throughout cosmic time. It steadily increased since cosmic dawn, up to a peak at z~2 (“cosmic noon”), followed by a sharp decline down to present age. What drove this evolution? In order to answer this question, we need to take a step back and study the gaseous content of galaxies at different redshifts. In particular, molecular gas is the medium from which stars form. To date, a few hundreds of galaxies at z>1 have been observed in their molecular gas emission, typically traced via rotational transitions of the carbon monoxide, CO. The vast majority of these galaxies was pre-selected based on their stellar mass, star formation rate, and/or nuclear activity. The ALMA Spectral Survey of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (ASPECS) offers a novel look into the gas content of high-redshift galaxies, by sampling CO and dust continuum emission in ample volumes of the universe without any pre-selection of the targeted galaxies. This enables a first volume-limited look into the build-up of gaseous reservoirs in different cosmic epochs. The ASPECS dust continuum map is the deepest image of an extragalactic deep field obtained so far at ~1.2mm, and allows us to resolve the cosmic infrared background at these wavelengths into individual, well-characterized galaxies. By combining our results with constraints on the stellar mass and neutral gas reservoirs in galaxies, we can complete the census of the baryonic cycle in galaxies throughout cosmic history.

Constrained by a comprehensive compilation of galaxy and AGN data, TRINITY predicts: (a) Typical host halo/galaxy masses for any SMBH population given their redshift, mass and/or Eddington ratio; (b) Average accretion and merger histories of SMBHs in different halos/galaxies (c) AGN duty cycles as a function of halo/galaxy mass and redshift. These predictions will give insights about the potential processes feeding gas to central SMBHs, as well as the feedback mechanisms coupling SMBHs to their host halos and galaxies. We will also use these predictions to prepare for future observations by, e.g., JWST, LSST, and LISA, etc.. In the future we will incorporate Trinity with the UniverseMachine to study environmental effects on the halo—galaxy—SMBH connection.

                                                    We have discovered more than 35 new luminous quasars at 6.5&lt; z &lt; 7.6 from our new quasar survey, which yields a large statistical quasar sample for the study of cosmic reionizaiton history. I will present our recent works related to the intergalactic medium (IGM)  evolution in the epoch of reionization using this new quasar sample. I will report new measurements of the IGM Lyman-alpha and Lyman-beta effective optical depth at 5.3&lt;z&lt;6.5. We measure the Lyman-alpha and Lyman-beta optical depth using the Lyman-alpha and Lyman-beta forests of both individual spectra and the stacked spectrum. Combining our new measurements and previous results, we obtain a best-fit for the Lyman-alpha optical depth evolution at z>5.3, tau ∝ (1+z)^(8.6+/-1.0). We also build a large high redshift transmission spike sample including more than 400 Lyman-alpha and Lyman-beta transmission spikes at 5.5&lt;z&lt;6.3. The existence of these transmission spikes at redshift up to z~6.3, suggests an ionized IGM at z~6.3 and a rapid transition phase of IGM neutral fraction from z~7 to z~6.3. In addition, our newly discovered z=7.52 quasar showing a weak damping wing feature indicates a lower neutral fraction than the estimates from other three z~7 quasars, suggesting a patchy reionization.

                                                Post-starburst galaxies (galaxies that were rapidly forming stars before quickly quenching star formation &lt;1Gyr ago) have proven to be useful probes of the way that galaxies change in morphology and become quiescent. While the “burst” in nearby post-starbursts generally contributed only ~5% to the pre-existing stellar mass, I and collaborators have identified a population of z~0.5-1 post-starbursts that appear to have just quenched their primary epoch of star formation. Followup ALMA observations have shown a huge variety in their molecular gas masses and fractions, suggesting a diversity of pathways to quiescence. In an unexpected surprise, I have found vast extended structures of molecular gas around a third of the detected galaxies in the sample, with nearly half of the total molecular mass extending up to ~50kpc outside the host galaxies. While I’ve come up with a few possible explanations for the origins of these highly-extended features, none of them is completely satisfying at this point. I will end by outlining some of our proposed followup observations and solicit wild speculation about any scenarios we haven’t yet considered.

                                                    The Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) instrument on the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope will offer an unprecedented view of the most distant galaxies. In preparation for future deep NIRCam extragalactic surveys, it is crucial to understand the color selection of high-redshift galaxies using the Lyman dropout technique. To that end, we have used the JAdes extraGalactic Ultradeep Artificial Realizations mock catalog to simulate a series of extragalactic surveys with realistic noise estimates. This enables us to explore different color selections and their impact on the number density of recovered high-redshift galaxies and lower-redshift interlopers. We explore how survey depth, detection signal-to-noise ratio, color selection method, detection filter choice, and the presence of the Lyα emission line affects the resulting dropout selected samples. We find that redder selection colors reduce the number of recovered high-redshift galaxies, but the overall accuracy of the final sample is higher. In addition, we find that methods that utilize two or three color cuts have higher accuracy because of their ability to select against low-redshift quiescent and faint dusty interloper galaxies. We also explore the near-IR colors of brown dwarfs and demonstrate that, while they are predicted to have low on-sky densities, they are most likely to be recovered in F090W dropout selection, but there are color cuts that help to mitigate this contamination. Overall, our results provide NIRCam selection methods to aid in the creation of large, pure samples of ultra-high-redshift galaxies from photometry alone.

                                                    Over a large range of redshifts, type-I quasar spectra are remarkably similar, indicating that the accretion mechanism and broad line region physics appear to remain the same over 11 billion years. As the number of known quasars in the epoch of reionization increases, do these sources still resemble their lower redshift counterparts?
                                                    Extensive near-infrared follow-up campaigns, probing the rest-frame UV emission, allow us, for the first time, to constrain the properties of this population. We have analyzed X-SHOOTER near-infrared spectroscopy of a large sample of 38 quasars at 5.78 &lt; z &lt; 7.54, which have complementary [CII] 158 μm ALMA observations. This X-SHOOTER/ALMA sample provides a comprehensive data set to study quasars in tandem with their host galaxy. In this talk I will discuss our results on the growth of supermassive black holes, early metal enrichment and the signatures of broad line region winds in the context of quasar evolution.

                                                    The protagonists of the last great phase transition of the universe - cosmic reionization - remain elusive. Faint star-forming galaxies are leading candidates because they are found to be numerous and may have significant ionizing photon escape fractions (fesc). In this talk I will update this picture via an empirical model that successfully predicts latest observations (e.g., the rapid drop in star-formation density (ρSFR at z > 8). We generate an ionizing spectrum for each galaxy in our model and constrain fesc by leveraging latest measurements of the reionization timeline (e.g., Lyα damping of quasars and galaxies at z > 7). We find MUV &lt; -13.5 galaxies need an average fesc of 0.2 to complete reionization. The inferred IGM neutral fraction is [0.9, 0.5, 0.1] at z=[8.2,6.8,6.2] ± 0.2 - that is, the bulk of reionization transpires rapidly in 300 Myr, driven by the z > 8 ρSFR and favored by high neutral fractions (∼60%-90%) measured at z ∼ 7-8. We propose a physically motivated model relating fesc to ΣSFR and find fesc scales as ΣSFR^{0.4±0.1}. Since ΣSFR falls by ∼2.5 dex between z = 8 and z = 0, our model explains the humble upper limits on fesc at lower redshifts and its required evolution to fesc ∼ 0.2 at z > 6. Within this model, strikingly, &lt;5% of galaxies with MUV &lt;-18 and log(M⋆/M☉) >8 (the "oligarchs") account for >80% of the reionization budget - a stark departure from the canonical "democratic" reionization led by copious faint sources. In fact, faint sources (MUV > -16) must be relegated to a limited role in order to ensure high neutral fractions at z = 7-8. Shallow faint-end slopes of the UV luminosity function (α>-2) and/or fesc distributions skewed toward massive galaxies produce the required late and rapid reionization. I will end by discussing new results that support this picture, and by proposing simple tests that are already achievable with current facilities.

                                                    A complete understanding of reionization would reveal the properties of the first stars and galaxies, as well as increasing the precision to which the intergalactic medium can be used as a cosmological probe. In this seminar I will present results from radiative transfer simulations of cosmic reionization. I will show that a model where reionization ends late (z ~ 5.3) can reproduce the distribution of observed effective optical depths of both the Lyman-alpha and Lyman-beta forests. I will further show that future observations of the Lyman-beta forest above redshift 6 will discriminate between different reionization histories.

                                                    A relatively simple model has emerged in recent years that can explain the bulk properties of high redshift galaxies: star formation is fueled by the inflow of pristine material from the intergalactic medium, and proceeds with an efficiency that depends strongly on the mass of a galaxy’s parent dark matter halo but not obviously on cosmic time. We generally interpret this mass dependence as a signature of stellar feedback despite the fact that stellar feedback models also predict time evolution in the star formation efficiency. In this talk, I’ll focus on this apparent tension, and show that to remain in agreement with observations, competing feedback scenarios require qualitatively different assumptions about the properties of dust and the duty cycle of star formation in galaxies. As a result, I’ll discuss the prospects for distinguishing models based on the ‘dustiness’ and ‘burstiness’ of galaxies found in upcoming galaxy surveys with JWST and ALMA, and potentially via constraints on reionization from future 21-cm experiments.

                                                    The reionization of hydrogen in the Universe's first billion years was likely caused by photons from the first galaxies. We will probably never observe these galaxies directly, but their properties can be inferred by measuring the timeline and morphology of reionization. I will describe how we can use galaxies at our current observational frontiers to measure the reionization process. In particular, Lyman-alpha (Lyα) emission can probe the intergalactic medium (IGM), but requires modelling physics from pc to Gpc scales. I will describe how we can constrain reionization from spectroscopy of galaxies, focusing on z>6 Lyα emission, by comparing observations to models and simulations using statistical inference methods. I will present measurements which favour a late and relatively rapid reionization, and place these in the context of high redshift galaxy formation, and I will describe how the lineshape of Lya can constrain detailed properties of reionizing bubbles, ionizing sources, and the high redshift IGM.

                                                Measuring Black Hole Masses in Early-Type Galaxies with ALMA

                                                    Supermassive black holes are found in the centers of all massive galaxies, and they are believed to play a major role in regulating the evolution of massive early-type galaxies. The relationships between black hole mass and host galaxy properties (including mass and velocity dispersion) provide important benchmarks for testing models of black hole-galaxy coevolution, and accurate measurements of black hole masses in nearby galaxies are essential for this work. It has long been anticipated that ALMA observations of molecular gas kinematics in galaxy nuclei could be used to measure the masses of central black holes, and during the past few years this method has been used to obtain robust mass measurements for several targets. I will present results from an ALMA program to observe massive early-type (E and S0) galaxies containing circumnuclear gas disks, and discuss how ALMA can now provide the most precise determinations of black hole masses at the upper end of the black hole mass range.
